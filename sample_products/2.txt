I do like the laptop. Wish it had a back light for the keyboard. The speed I’ve noticed the be a little slow.
I like the size, the colors/pixels when I use my personal web cam , are not vibrant as I would hope it would be.

Also, it’s advertised as being sold with Microsoft Office. My computer came with Microsoft Personal.

1.0 out of 5 stars external drive must be connected AT ALL TIMES

This laptop has to have the external drive connected to it at all times to properly function. This requirement was not stated and was not clearly explained in the product description. The very definition of a laptop is portability and by requiring the external hard drive to be connected like an umbilical cord at all times is cumbersome and awkward and does not meet my expectations. I will say the supplier offered and gave me a full refund when I expressed my displeasure with the functionality or the laptop, so 5 stars to the supplier for that, 1 star for the computer itself.

Got this laptop for the wife for some productivity apps like library apps and recipe storage plus the occasional sims game. She likes it and that's what counts. It boots quick and everything was in working order.

This computer is so slow, but it works, so there’s that.

Complete false advertising. Said it's got over 600GB of storage and it came with just over 100gb. Ridiculous.
