The MacBook Air M2 with 16GB RAM is an outstanding laptop. It handles multitasking and demanding tasks like video editing effortlessly. The battery life is exceptional, easily lasting a full day, and the lightweight design makes it perfect for on-the-go use.

The Liquid Retina display is stunning, and the keyboard and trackpad are top-notch. While the limited ports require an adapter for peripherals, the overall performance, sleek design, and future-proofing make this a fantastic investment. Highly recommend!

My mother’s 8 year old MacBook has begun to get sluggish, so I’ve been looking for a replacement. This one was just what she needed. She’s 79, so she doesn’t need all the bells and whistles. This MacBook Air is perfect for her. We very easily migrated the data from her old MacBook and she was up and running in no time.

Goes well with Anker 547 USB-C Hub (7-in-2) and Cable Matters USB C to DisplayPort 1.4 Cable if you have a 5K@144Hz monitor (in my case an LG UltraGear+ 49"). Performs notably faster than the M1, has the break-away power port that's always saved my bacon, 16 GB of RAM (yes, this does make a difference for me), and the SSD is fast enough that I didn't see any purpose upgrading storage.

4.0 out of 5 stars Excellent as a secondary computer, not ideal as a primary computer.
Reviewed in the United States on February 17, 2025
Capacity: 16GB Unified Memory, 256GB SSD StorageColor: StarlightSet: without AppleCare+Verified Purchase
I bought this MacBook Air in February with my tax return. So far, I've been liking it a lot. I had an Intel MacBook Air computer and the keyboard was awful. If I used it for too long and pressed the buttons my fingers would hurt. That was my main reason for upgrading. So when I saw that Amazon was selling the MacBook M2 Air for $799, I jumped at the opportunity.

So let's first preface this review for what this computer is NOT. This computer is not the most powerful computer ever. It's very fast and snappy. It open apps without a problem (such as Safari, Messenger, Discord, Facebook Messenger, etc.) You won't have any issues with it if you use primary web-based applications. Think Google Sheets, Google Word, Microsoft Office Suite, Asana, the list goes on and on. If you need a computer to use web-based applications this computer is ideal for that usage. The MacBook Air M2 is ideal if you have a secondary computer at home for certain tasks, such as printing and scanning documents.

You should have your desktop computer at home - this will allow you to do things this computer cannot, such as printing documents or playing certain types of video games. Unfortunately, if you need to connect anything with a USB-A port, you're out of luck. This means you need to buy an extra connector for USB thumb drives, SD cards, external hard drives, web-cams, and other USB enabled devices. Ideally, you need to buy Apple's adapter. Unfortunately not all adapters are made equal. I had an old UGreen USC Hub that I used to connect my old laptop to my monitor. This MacBook Air M2 did not accept that, so I had to buy an Apple Official USB to HDMI converter to connect it. (which cost me $50 at the Apple Store). I later learned that this was because of the software of the computer. I think that it's a little insidious of Apple to not allow certain hardware to work because of a software block. This is a MacBook, not a Windows Book. While you do have the option to install Parallels on this computer, ideally this computer is meant to run a Mac Operating System. There will be certain programs and apps that just won't work. I got this computer and it had MacOS Sequoia pre-installed. I really like it. Unfortunately I can't downgrade to older versions of MacOS such as Ventura or Sonoma even those this computer originally supported it. So be aware if this is a feature that is important to you.

I will never use this computer to its full potential. I am not a video editor, nor do I edit pictures on my computer. This computer is ideal for those tasks. However I doubt that 80 to 90 percent of the people are going to buy this computer to perform those tasks. Most of my use-case for this computer will be applying for jobs online, checking my bank account balance, taking random notes throughout the day, and buying things on Amazon. So essentially I am using this computer almost like an Apple Chromebook. It's excellent to go on the internet with and watch movies. And it's also excellent if you want to write documents, chat with friends, and do some light tasks like playing Terraria and Minecraft on your computer.

Let's talk about Apple's pricing strategy and FOMO for a second. Very few people need 24 GB of RAM and 1 Terabyte of storage. It's more ideal to buy a pre-built computer or buy a used Desktop iMac if you need this computer for certain scenarios, such as editing videos, computing AI or computer algorithms, or building a network server at home. Your money will stretch much further. I got the 16GB model and so far I love the computer. It wouldn't matter if you got 8GB or an upgraded version.

What I've learned with Apple computers is that if you have 8GB of memory, the Apple Operating System will use close to 8GB just by doing basic tasks like surfing the web and watching videos. If you have 16GB the computer will use close to 16GB just by doing basic tasks. So just get the best computer with the budget you have now. 8GB will perform close to 16GB - the only difference is that you can have more applications open at once with the 16GB.

Ultimately, this computer is probably meant to be disposable. There's no way to upgrade the RAM or the Hard Drive. If the screen breaks, I'm sure that the screen would cost at least 500-600 dollars to replace. At that point it's probably a better idea just to get a new computer. It's a shame that Apple doesn't make their computers upgradable anymore. It gives consumers more choice after a year or two if their needs change.

Ok enough bashing of this computer. Let's talk positives.

This keyboard is luxurious to type on. My old Intel MacBook with the Butterfly keys gave me pain so I would have to stop every hour or two. I hated typing on that thing. This review was typed up on an MacBook Air M2 and I just love how the keys feel.

The speakers are great. They're not the best, but they are excellent compared to many Dell laptops I used.

The function keys on the top are useful. Volume Up and Down, Brightness Up and Down are really handy in a pinch. On Windows Machines you have to click or you have to press two keys in order to change the screen brightness or volume. I love the fact that you can adjust it with a press of a button.

The screen is high quality. Again it is not the most brightest laptop screen that I've used. It is more that good enough for use indoors or outdoors.

The trackpad click is very satisfying to click on. It's awesome. I don't use my mouse sometimes, just the trackpad.

I don't use the webcam, but I've heard good things about it. It's good enough for most people who need Microsoft Teams or Zoom.

The battery is excellent. You never have to worry about battery life. I used to have a 2014 MacBook Air and the battery of that computer would die after 3 hours so I would have to carry a charger around. You don't have to worry about that issue with this computer. I've gotten all-day battery life just doing basic tasks such as browsing Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft Excel.

I think this computer is stylish. I got the Starlight version and it's a slightly yellowish/champagne color.

This computer is excellent so far and I've been enjoying it.

So here would be the customer that ideally should buy this laptop.
-if you want an M Series computer - get it.
-if you're tired of Apple's butter keyboard -get it.
-if you have an iPhone -get it because you can sync your messages to this computer
-if you hate Windows OS like me lol - get it
-if you have an Intel Based Mac and you want to try what else is out there- get it
-if you want all-day battery life- get it
-if you're willing to spend another 20-50 dollars after you buy this computer for the necessary dongles and connectors - get it
-if you're willing to accept that this computer is non-upgradable and you might need to upgrade again in 3-4 years- get it.

First macbook I have owned ,I have been a windows/android person for ever . I did not want a iphone just to play with the software so I am trying this macbook air 16gb. Very nice machine even though I only use it for online. I do enjoy learning mac os but surprised it did not do many of the features that Iphone has. I did not like the apple TV, Music or other apps on the unit. I wanted to use Safari browser and now perfect for online searching , Netflix and Amazon Prime video. 2022 model I saved a couple of hundred bucks.

My biggest issue has been getting used to the different software included with or available for this MacBook. The MacBook has become my main computer and that says a lot for someone who has used a PC since the 90’s
